# Robot framework - Project setup

Before you start the installation, make sure that you already have some of the above installed.
In command line write :

```
python --version
robot --version
pip --version-
chromedriver --version
```

## Install Tools:
- [Install python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [Install Robot Framework](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework/)
- [Install SeleniumLibrary and WebDrivers](http://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/)

## Integrated Development Environment

You can use a text editor such as Atom to write tests in Robot
- [Install Atom](https://atom.io/)

I recommend installing the following plugin if you are going to use Atom
or any other 'text editor'

```
gitlab-integration
language-robot-framework
autocomplete-robot-framework
```

We can write tests in Robot anywhere , in IntelliJ and in Eclipse IDE, VSCode, etc.
Within these IDE we need to integrate some plugins as well as for Atom text editor
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Install IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
- [Install Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

#### Robocorp Lab
This is special IDE only for Robot framework that adjusts the environment for us (Python , robot ...)

## Official documentation
- [Robot framework user guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/#user-guide)
- [Standard libraries](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/#standard-libraries)

## Recommendation
To make this framework easier to understand, I recommend the following tutorials and documentation 
- [Robocorp beginner course](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/beginners-course) Short course in Robocorp lab (introduction to framework and IDE)
- [Test Automation University - Robot framework](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/robot-framework-tutorial/) Also a course that goes through the installation and writing of tests in Visual Studio.
